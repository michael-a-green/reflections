_What happens when you initialize a reposity? Why do you need to do it?_

git creates a .git directory where meta data is stored to let git know about the changes
and status of a given repository. You need to do this so that git can track changes and
status of all files in the repository.

* git init : Initializes a repository
* git status: Gives you status of the repo  of a the last change
* git add : adds files to the staging area

_How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value
do you think it offers?_

The staging area is a place the shows you which files will be part of the next commit. It
allows you to see what will be in the commit before actually performing the commit and enables
you to change it before doing the commit.
